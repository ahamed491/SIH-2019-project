It is a web application with a map showing different ATI routes along with navigational aids and waypoints.
The main thing is to predict alternate routes in cases like prohibited area and show it in the map.
we used Djikstras algorithm to find all neighboring waypoints/navigational Aids and showed the next shortest path from blocked area to destination.
